'''
Due to the input being called & tested
in the is_number_inp_valid function,
any tests that relate to validity of input, like 
one's in the assignment: (zero, negative values and textual values, etc.),
should be tested through validity function. 

This means that Calcs are only subject to mathematical correctness
checks.
