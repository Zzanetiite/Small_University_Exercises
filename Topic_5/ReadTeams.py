'''
Code a program that:

Opens a file called teams.txt
o	Reads one row at a time and outputs the
details of the teams as separate rows on the console.

o	Tidy up the output so the data is shown in columns
where strings are left justified and numbers right justified
and showing a currency sign for team values.

o	Print a set of appropriate column headings before the team data.
